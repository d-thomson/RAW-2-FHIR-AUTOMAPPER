Provide instructions [“navigate to this URL… type in this… click on that…etc.”] for us (Instructors/OMs) to follow in order to run your application, please identify these details in a file called “Special Instructions – <Team Name>.pdf” This file is to be placed in “Final Delivery” directory. This file is not optional. We expect to launch your application via a docker-compose.yml file to be found at the root of the repository. If your software development process/tool caused the docker-compose file to be in a different folder and/or you have special build/launch instructions, also include these details in the “Special Instructions” PDF.
