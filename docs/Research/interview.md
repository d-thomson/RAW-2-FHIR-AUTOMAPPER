Followup Email after discussing the requirements with Alvin.

> Hi Alvin,
>
> We discussed what we want the team to do for this project:
>
> - Given a DB connection
> - Get DDLs for tables as well as table data
> - Look at column names and data
> - Map to nearest FHIR term
> - Display the original EHR on the left with suggested mappings on the right.
> - A person then confirms or rejects the suggested mapping
>      - Rejected mappings either default to a full list or a "less likely" list of options
> - Save the mapping for future use
> -- Extra - actually move the data into new or existing tables
> 
> We will start with openly available EHR datasets that we can connect to or that we can host databases for testing.
