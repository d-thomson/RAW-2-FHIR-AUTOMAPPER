EMR systems have existed for a long time, and have helped doctors and hospitals streamline operations, however, lack of interoperability amongst different EMR systems is still a massive problem and poses hurdles for both patients and healthcare providers.


On an average, hospitals use more than 10 different EMR vendors – further complicating interoperability. The FHIR standard can potentially solve this problem. However, there is still a need for a tool that can map the databases from different EMR systems into the FHIR stanard.

Growth in Adoption of EMR Systems:
* 2008: Only 4% of providers utilized EMR systems
* 2018: Most hospitals and 50% of providers utilize EMR Systems

Disparate EMR Systems:
* As EMRs have exploded in adoption over the last 10 years, many standards were developed for different areas
* Multiple standards were developed in the same areas such as clinical documentation, relationships, and processes

Interoperability Problems
Many data standards:
ICD-10         NDC
CPT              SNOMED
LOINC          RxNORM

FHIR - Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource
Standard utilizing APIs to exchange data and first released in 2014
Some existing EMR systems utilize "FHIR Adapters" to solve interoperability with new FHIR standard

Most hospitals and half of providers have adopted electronic record systems
A current domain issue is interoperability of these systems
Why have interoperability?
EMR's become more valuable with the ability to share information
Gain ability to interact with other vendors that have support for FHIR
Electronic exchange of health information will improve quality of healthcare
